<h1><b>RetroGames</b> | Logic Building By Creating Games</h1>

Growing up,I've been a huge fan of video games since my childhood.. So,when I got into programming,it only made sense to try to understand and re-create the logic behind some of the games I grew up playing. Inspired by Dan Shiffman (Coding Train) and Ania Kubow,this repo was created to develop programming logic by creating some fun games!!
